### 3. **Edit Department Modal - Leader Search**

**Location**: `EditDepartmentModal.tsx`

**Feature**: Same search functionality as Create Department modal

**Functionality**: Identical to Create Department modal

---

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

Each component now includes a search term state:

```typescript
const [memberSearchTerm, setMemberSearchTerm] = useState('');
// or
const [leaderSearchTerm, setLeaderSearchTerm] = useState('');
```

### Filtering Logic

**Case-insensitive search** across multiple fields:

```typescript
const filteredMembers = members.filter(member => {
  if (!searchTerm) return true;
  const searchLower = searchTerm.toLowerCase();
  const firstName = (member.firstName || member.first_name || '').toLowerCase();
  const lastName = (member.lastName || member.last_name || '').toLowerCase();
  const email = (member.email || '').toLowerCase();
  const memberId = String(member.memberId || member.member_id || member.id).toLowerCase();
  const phoneNumber = (member.phoneNumber || member.phone_number || '').toLowerCase();
  
  return firstName.includes(searchLower) || 
         lastName.includes(searchLower) || 
         email.includes(searchLower) ||
         memberId.includes(searchLower) || 
         phoneNumber.includes(searchLower);
});
```

### UI Components

**Search Input Structure**:
- Text input with left search icon
- Right clear button (shows only when text entered)
- Placeholder text for guidance
- Consistent styling across all modals

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- ✅ Client-side filtering (no API calls)
- ✅ Efficient array filtering
- ✅ Case-insensitive search (converted to lowercase once)
- ✅ No re-rendering of entire list on every keystroke

### Scalability
- Works well with current 351 members
- May need virtualization if member count exceeds 1000+
- Consider server-side search for very large datasets

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Fuzzy search** - Match similar names (Jon vs John)
2. **Search by role** - Filter leaders by their role
3. **Multi-field display** - Show more info in search results
4. **Recent selections** - Show recently selected members first
5. **Keyboard navigation** - Arrow keys to navigate filtered results
6. **Search history** - Remember recent searches

### Advanced Features
1. **Auto-complete** - Suggest members as you type
2. **Tags/Categories** - Filter by department, ministry, etc.
3. **Bulk actions** - Select all matching search results
4. **Export filtered results** - Download filtered member list
