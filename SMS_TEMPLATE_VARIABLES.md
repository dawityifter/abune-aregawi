## 🎨 UI Features

### **Template Variable Helper Box:**
When you select "Pending Pledges" or "Fulfilled Pledges", the UI displays:

✅ **Green helper box** with all available template variables  
✅ **Example placeholder** in the textarea  
✅ **Reminder** that each member gets a personalized message

### **Smart Defaults:**
- **Single pledge:** Use `{amount}` and `{dueDate}`
- **Multiple pledges:** Use `{totalAmount}` and `{pledgeCount}`
- The system automatically handles both cases!

## 💻 How It Works (Technical)

### **Backend Processing:**

1. **Query pledges** by status (pending/fulfilled)
2. **Aggregate by member** - collect all pledges for each member
3. **Calculate totals** - sum up pledge amounts per member
4. **Template substitution** - replace variables for each member
5. **Send personalized SMS** - each member gets their own message

### **Template Substitution Logic:**

```javascript
// For a member with 2 pending pledges ($300 + $200)
const templateData = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  amount: 300.00,           // First pledge (if single)
  totalAmount: 500.00,      // Sum of all pledges
  pledgeCount: 2,           // Number of pledges
  dueDate: "2025-12-31"     // First pledge due date (if single)
};

// Message template
"Hi {firstName}, you have {pledgeCount} pledges totaling {totalAmount}"

// Becomes
"Hi John, you have 2 pledges totaling $500.00"
```
