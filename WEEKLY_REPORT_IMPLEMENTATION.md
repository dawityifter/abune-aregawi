## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. ✅ Select current week → Shows all transactions
2. ✅ Navigate to previous week → Updates data
3. ✅ Expand cash section → Shows income and expenses
4. ✅ Net calculation → Income - Expenses = Correct

### Edge Cases
1. ✅ Week with no transactions → Shows "No transactions found"
2. ✅ Week with only income → No expense section shown
3. ✅ Week with only expenses → Negative net to deposit (highlighted)
4. ✅ Invalid date (not Monday) → Returns error message

### Data Scenarios
1. ✅ Multiple collectors → Each shown separately
2. ✅ Multiple expense categories → All listed
3. ✅ Mixed payment methods → Each in own section
4. ✅ System collected (Zelle) → Shows "System" as collector

## 📝 Key Calculations

### Net to Deposit Per Payment Method
```javascript
netToDeposit = totalIncome - totalExpenses
```

### Overall Net Total
```javascript
netTotal = sum of all netToDeposit across payment methods
```

### Example
```
Cash Income: $8,000
Cash Expenses: $2,000
Cash Net: $6,000 ✅

Check Income: $4,000
Check Expenses: $1,500
Check Net: $2,500 ✅

Overall Net: $6,000 + $2,500 + $2,000 = $10,500 ✅
```
