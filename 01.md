## Problem

We want to build mobile first web application for our Abune Aregawi Tigray Orthodox Church
It will make members stay active, engaged and connected by keeping them informed about service times, upcoming events calendar (with RSVP/Signup options), announcements and news, emergency alerts or schedule changes.
It will also make participation easy by providing volunteer signups, online giving and sermon archive or livestream for those who cant attend in person.
It fosters connection with member portal or private community area, contact forms for priests, ministry leaders and care teams.
It stays accissible by being mobile friendly (easy to navigate on phones), social media integration (sharable content and event invites), email and text subscription options for updates.
Welcoming new comes with clear info about what to expect during services and intro to the Church's missions, beleifs and leadership.
Encourage spritual growth with video or zoom mesages that can be watched anytime as well as daily devotional bible study guides.
This web application will be able to help parishioners login, view their dues and pay when necessary.
The web application will be multi lingual with English and Tigrigna.
