# Payment System Fixes - October 10, 2025

## Summary

Fixed two critical issues in the Add Payment screen for treasurers:
1. **Income GL Code not populating** when selecting payment types
2. **Anonymous payments failing** with database constraint error

---

## Issue 1: Income GL Code Not Populating

### Problem
When treasurers selected a payment type in the Add Payment modal, the Income Category (GL Code) field remained empty instead of auto-populating with the correct GL code.

### Root Cause
**INC007** (Event Hall & Church Item Rental) had `payment_type_mapping: 'event'`, creating a duplicate mapping conflict with **INC003** (Fundraising). When the `getIncomeCategoryByPaymentType()` function searched for categories, it would return inconsistent results depending on array order.

### Solution

**Backend Changes:**

1. **Updated seed data** (`backend/src/database/seedIncomeCategories.js`)
   - Changed INC007 `payment_type_mapping` from `'event'` to `null`
   - INC007 now requires manual selection (as originally intended)

2. **Created migration** (`backend/src/database/migrations/fixINC007Mapping.js`)
   - Updated existing database records to remove the duplicate mapping
   - Ran successfully and verified with database query

3. **Updated documentation** (`backend/PAYMENT_TYPE_MAPPINGS.md`)
   - Documented the issue and fix
   - Added database fix section

**Frontend Changes:**

4. **Cleaned up debug logging** (`frontend/src/components/admin/AddPaymentModal.tsx`)
   - Removed temporary diagnostic console logs
   - Kept clean, production-ready code

### Current GL Code Mappings

| Payment Type | GL Code | Category Name |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| membership_due | INC001 | Membership |
| offering | INC002 | Weekly Offering |
| tithe | INC002 | Weekly Offering (via fallback) |
| event | INC003 | Fundraising |
| building_fund | INC003 | Fundraising (via fallback) |
| donation | INC004 | Special Donation |
| vow | INC008 | Vow & Tselot |
| other | INC999 | Other Income |

**Manual selection required:** INC005, INC006, INC007

## Issue 2: Anonymous Payments Failing

### Problem
When treasurers tried to add anonymous payments, the system returned a 500 error:
```
"null value in column \"member_id\" of relation \"transactions\" violates not-null constraint"
```

### Root Causes

**Two separate issues:**

1. **Database schema mismatch**: The `transactions.member_id` column had a NOT NULL constraint, but the Sequelize model correctly defined it as nullable. Anonymous payments require `member_id` to be NULL.

2. **Missing payment type enums**: The frontend sent payment types like `'offering'`, `'vow'`, and `'building_fund'`, but the database enum only included `'membership_due'`, `'tithe'`, `'donation'`, `'event'`, `'other'`.

### Solution

**Backend Changes:**

1. **Made member_id nullable** (`backend/src/database/migrations/makeTransactionMemberIdNullable.js`)
   - Dropped existing foreign key constraint
   - Altered `member_id` column to allow NULL values
   - Re-added foreign key with SET NULL behavior
   - Verified change in database

2. **Added missing payment types** (`backend/src/database/migrations/addMissingPaymentTypes.js`)
   - Added `'offering'`, `'vow'`, `'building_fund'` to enum
   - Verified all 8 payment types now exist in enum

3. **Updated Transaction model** (`backend/src/models/Transaction.js`)
   - Updated payment_type ENUM to include all 8 types
   - Model now matches database schema exactly

### Supported Payment Types

After fix, the following payment types are supported:
- `membership_due` - Membership fees
- `tithe` - Tithes
- `offering` - Weekly offerings  
- `donation` - General donations
- `vow` - Vows (Selet)
- `building_fund` - Building fund contributions
- `event` - Event-related payments
- `other` - Other payments

## Testing Instructions

### Test GL Code Population

1. Log in as treasurer
2. Open Treasurer Dashboard
3. Click "Add Payment"
4. Select "Member Payment" mode
5. Choose a member
6. Test each payment type:
   - **Membership Fee** → Should show "INC001 - Membership"
   - **Tithe** → Should show "INC002 - Weekly Offering"
   - **Offering** → Should show "INC002 - Weekly Offering"
   - **Building Fund** → Should show "INC003 - Fundraising"
   - **Other Donation** → Should show "INC004 - Special Donation"
   - **Vow** → Should show "INC008 - Vow (Selet) & Tselot"

### Test Anonymous Payments

1. Open Add Payment modal
2. Select "Anonymous / Non-Member Payment" radio button
3. Fill in optional donor information:
   - Donor Type: Individual or Organization
   - Donor Name (optional)
   - Email (optional)
   - Phone (optional)
   - Memo (optional)
4. Select payment type (membership_due should be hidden)
5. Verify GL code populates automatically
6. Enter amount and select payment method
7. For Cash/Check: Enter receipt number
8. Click "Add Payment"
9. Should succeed with 201 status
10. Verify payment appears in transaction list with donor info in notes

## Database Verification

Run these queries to verify the fixes:

```sql
-- Verify INC007 has no payment_type_mapping
SELECT gl_code, name, payment_type_mapping 
FROM income_categories 
WHERE gl_code = 'INC007';
-- Expected: payment_type_mapping is NULL

-- Verify member_id is nullable
SELECT column_name, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'transactions' 
AND column_name = 'member_id';
-- Expected: is_nullable = 'YES'

-- Verify all payment types exist
SELECT unnest(enum_range(NULL::enum_transactions_payment_type));
-- Expected: 8 types including offering, vow, building_fund

-- Test anonymous payment creation
SELECT id, member_id, payment_type, amount, note
FROM transactions
WHERE member_id IS NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
-- Should return anonymous transactions without error
```

---

## Deployment Notes

**Migrations to run in production:**
1. `fixINC007Mapping.js` - Removes duplicate GL code mapping
2. `makeTransactionMemberIdNullable.js` - Allows NULL member_id
3. `addMissingPaymentTypes.js` - Adds missing payment type enums

**Backend restart required:** Yes (model changes)

**Frontend rebuild required:** No (only debug logging removed)

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback steps:

```sql
-- Rollback member_id nullable change
ALTER TABLE transactions ALTER COLUMN member_id SET NOT NULL;

-- Rollback INC007 mapping (if needed)
UPDATE income_categories 
SET payment_type_mapping = 'event' 
WHERE gl_code = 'INC007';
```

Note: Payment type enum changes cannot be easily rolled back. Test thoroughly before deploying.
