# Fix: Preserve Route on Page Refresh

## Problem

When user is on a specific page like `/admin`, `/treasurer`, `/outreach`, etc. and hits the browser refresh button, they were being redirected to `/dashboard` instead of staying on their current page.

## Root Cause

1. **AuthContext** was automatically redirecting to `/dashboard` after successfully loading user profile on ANY page except specific public pages
2. **SignIn component** was always redirecting to `/dashboard` after OTP verification, ignoring the intended destination

## Solution

### 1. Updated SignIn Component

**File**: `/frontend/src/components/auth/SignIn.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `useLocation` hook to access route state
- Modified post-OTP navigation to check for intended route from `location.state.from`
- Falls back to `/dashboard` if no intended route

```typescript
// Before:
navigate('/dashboard', { replace: true });

// After:
const intendedRoute = (location.state as any)?.from?.pathname || '/dashboard';
navigate(intendedRoute, { replace: true });
```

### 2. Updated AuthContext

**File**: `/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Changed redirect logic to only redirect FROM specific pages TO dashboard
- Allows users to stay on protected pages like `/admin`, `/treasurer`, etc. after refresh

**Before Logic**:
```typescript
// Redirect to dashboard if NOT on these pages:
const NO_REDIRECT_PATHS = ['/'];
if (!NO_REDIRECT_PATHS.has(currentPath) && currentPath !== '/dashboard') {
  navigate('/dashboard'); // ❌ Redirects from /admin, /treasurer, etc.
}
```

**After Logic**:
```typescript
// Only redirect to dashboard if ON these pages:
const REDIRECT_TO_DASHBOARD_PATHS = ['/login', '/', '/credits', ...];
if (REDIRECT_TO_DASHBOARD_PATHS.has(currentPath)) {
  navigate('/dashboard'); // ✅ Only redirects from public/login pages
} else {
  console.log('✅ User already on protected route, staying on:', currentPath);
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: User Refreshes on Protected Page
1. User is on `/admin`
2. User hits refresh
3. Firebase auth state loads
4. Backend profile loads
5. AuthContext sees user is on `/admin` (not in redirect list)
6. **User stays on `/admin`** ✅

### Scenario 2: User Logs In and Was Trying to Access Protected Page
1. User tries to access `/treasurer` but not logged in
2. ProtectedRoute redirects to `/login` with `state={{ from: location }}`
3. User enters OTP
4. SignIn component checks `location.state.from.pathname` = `/treasurer`
5. **User navigates to `/treasurer`** ✅

### Scenario 3: User Logs In From Login Page Directly
1. User goes to `/login` directly
2. User enters OTP
3. SignIn component checks `location.state.from.pathname` = undefined
4. **User navigates to `/dashboard`** (default) ✅

### Scenario 4: User Refreshes on Public Page
1. User is on `/` (home page)
2. User hits refresh
3. Firebase auth state loads
4. AuthContext sees user is on `/` (in redirect list)
5. **User navigates to `/dashboard`** ✅

## Pages That Stay Put on Refresh

All protected pages now preserve their route on refresh:
- ✅ `/admin` - Admin Dashboard
- ✅ `/treasurer` - Treasurer Dashboard
- ✅ `/outreach` - Outreach Dashboard
- ✅ `/profile` - User Profile
- ✅ `/sms` - SMS Broadcast
- ✅ `/dues` - Dues Page
- ✅ `/dependents` - Dependents Management
- ✅ `/dashboard` - Main Dashboard

## Pages That Redirect to Dashboard

These pages redirect to dashboard if user is authenticated:
- `/login` - Login page
- `/` - Home page
- `/credits` - Credits page
- `/church-bylaw` - Church Bylaw
- `/donate` - Donation page
- `/member-status` - Member Status
- `/parish-pulse-sign-up` - Parish Pulse Sign Up

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Refresh on Admin Page
1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to `/admin`
3. Hit browser refresh (F5)
4. **Expected**: Stay on `/admin` ✅

### Test Case 2: Refresh on Treasurer Page
1. Log in as treasurer
2. Navigate to `/treasurer`
3. Hit browser refresh (F5)
4. **Expected**: Stay on `/treasurer` ✅

### Test Case 3: Login Flow With Intended Route
1. Log out
2. Try to access `/admin` (without being logged in)
3. Get redirected to `/login`
4. Enter phone and OTP
5. **Expected**: Get redirected to `/admin` ✅

### Test Case 4: Direct Login
1. Log out
2. Go to `/login` directly
3. Enter phone and OTP
4. **Expected**: Get redirected to `/dashboard` ✅

## Benefits

✅ **Better User Experience** - Users stay where they were
✅ **No Lost Context** - Admin doesn't lose their place when refreshing
✅ **Natural Navigation** - Behaves like a traditional web app
✅ **Intent Preservation** - Users trying to access protected pages get there after login
