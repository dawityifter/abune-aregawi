## Stripe Dashboard Verification

   - [ ] Email matches expected
   - [ ] Metadata includes memberId (if applicable)
   - [ ] Metadata includes purpose

   - [ ] Customer created/updated with correct email
   - [ ] Phone number included (if available)

3. **Receipt**
   - [ ] Receipt sent to correct email

## Backend Logs to Monitor

Check your backend logs for each test:

```
âœ… "Payment intent created for member ID: XXX"
âœ… "Using member email: john.test@example.com" OR
âœ… "No member email found, using default: abunearegawitx@gmail.com" OR
âœ… "Using provided email: newemail@example.com"
âœ… "Transaction recorded successfully"
```

---

## Database Verification

After each test, check your transactions table:

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  member_id,
  amount,
  payment_method,
  external_id,
  created_at,
  -- Check if any email field is stored
FROM transactions 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Production Readiness Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All 12 test scenarios pass
- [ ] Backend correctly handles missing emails
- [ ] Backend correctly handles provided emails
- [ ] Backend correctly applies default email
- [ ] Stripe webhooks handle all payment statuses
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Console has no errors
- [ ] Backend logs show correct email logic
- [ ] Test with real staging members
- [ ] Verify email receipts go to correct addresses
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (responsive)
- [ ] Test with slow network (throttle connection)

## Common Issues to Watch For

### Issue 1: Backend Not Handling Empty Email
**Symptom:** Payment fails when member has no email
**Solution:** Update backend to check for empty/null email and apply default

### Issue 2: Stripe Receipt Goes to Wrong Email
**Symptom:** Receipt goes to default even when email provided
**Solution:** Verify frontend is actually sending the email in payload

### Issue 3: Email Field Shows "undefined"
**Symptom:** Email field displays "undefined" text
**Solution:** Ensure empty string fallback, not undefined

### Issue 4: Payment Succeeds but Transaction Not Recorded
**Symptom:** Stripe shows payment but database doesn't
**Solution:** Check webhook handling and error logs
