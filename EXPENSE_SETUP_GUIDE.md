```

### Step 2: Start Backend

- Check backend is running (`npm run dev`)
- Verify database migration ran successfully
- Check browser console for API errors

### "Invalid GL code"
- Ensure you ran the seed script: `npm run db:seed:expenses`
- Check database: `SELECT * FROM expense_categories;`

### "Cannot see Add Expense button"
- Verify user role is **Treasurer** or **Admin**
- Check user permissions in browser DevTools

### Database connection errors
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` in backend `.env` file
- Check PostgreSQL is running
- Ensure SSL settings match your environment
