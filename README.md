  - Computes member payment status from `yearly_pledge` and actual payments
  - New "Contributing Members" metric shows members with active pledges
  - Up-to-date vs Behind tracking based on expected-to-date calculations
  - Uses normalized `ledger_entries` table for consistent reporting
- ‚úÖ **Anonymous Payment Support**: Full treasurer capability for non-member donations
  - Accept payments from truly anonymous donors, named non-members, or groups
  - Separate donor fields: type (Individual/Organization), name, email, phone, memo
  - All payment methods supported (cash, check, card, ACH)
  - Business rule: Membership dues require a member (cannot be anonymous)
  - Transaction list displays anonymous donations with "Non-Member" badge
- ‚úÖ **Payment Validation**: Minimum payment amount of $1.00 enforced
  - Frontend validation with clear error messages
  - Backend validation at controller and model levels
  - Applied to all payment types and methods

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Hosting**: Migrated from Vercel to Firebase Hosting with asset path fixes

- ‚úÖ **Phone Number Formatting**: Comprehensive E.164 normalization throughout app

### Frontend Testing Utilities
- ‚úÖ Added reusable auth testing utilities at `frontend/src/testUtils/authTestUtils.ts`
  - `setFirebaseUserToken(firebaseUser, token)`: standardize mocking of `firebaseUser.getIdToken()`
  - `extractHeader(headers, key)`: safely read headers from `Headers` or plain objects
- Example usage in `frontend/src/components/admin/__tests__/OutreachDashboard.test.tsx`:

```ts
import { setFirebaseUserToken, extractHeader } from '../../../testUtils/authTestUtils';

beforeEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();
  setFirebaseUserToken(mockFirebaseUser, 'test-token');
});

// Later, when validating fetch calls
const headers = postCall[1]?.headers as any;
expect(extractHeader(headers, 'Authorization')).toBe('Bearer test-token');
```

### Running Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test -- --watchAll=false --runInBand
```
Notes:
- Tests mock Firebase Auth and network requests; no external services are called.
- React Router v7 future-flag warnings are expected and safe to ignore during tests.

### Communications (SMS & Outreach)
- ‚úÖ Restored SMS messaging module using Twilio in the backend
  - Endpoint uses Firebase auth; frontend passes ID token in Authorization header
  - Member dropdown search fixed to use `search` query param against `/api/members/all/firebase`
  - Logs persisted to `SmsLog` table via Sequelize
- ‚úÖ Dashboard cards
  - Communications card (links to `/sms`) visible to roles with `canSendCommunications` (Admin, Church Leadership, Secretary)
  - Relationship Department card (links to `/outreach`) visible when `canAccessOutreachDashboard` or `canManageOnboarding`
- ‚úÖ Navigation cleanup
  - Removed SMS, Outreach, and Admin links from the top header to reduce duplication
  - Access these via the Dashboard cards

- **Audit Trail**: All role changes are logged for security

#### **Role Validation**
- **Database Consistency**: Roles validated against PostgreSQL enum values
- **Frontend Validation**: Role-based UI rendering and access control
- **API Protection**: Backend middleware enforces role-based permissions

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation

#### **Frontend Security**
```typescript
// Role-based component rendering
{userRole === 'admin' && <AdminDashboard />}
{['admin', 'church_leadership'].includes(userRole) && <MemberDirectory />}
{['admin', 'treasurer'].includes(userRole) && <FinancialReports />}
```

#### **Backend Security**
```javascript
// Role-based middleware
const requireRole = (roles) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (!roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ 
        success: false, 
        message: 'access.denied' 
      });
    }
    next();
  };
};
```

#### **API Endpoint Protection**
- **Public Endpoints**: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`
- **Member Endpoints**: Profile management, children management
- **Admin Endpoints**: User management, system configuration
- **Role-Specific Endpoints**: Financial reports, member directory

### üìä Role Statistics & Analytics

The admin dashboard provides insights into role distribution and usage:

- **Role Distribution**: Percentage of users in each role
- **Activity Metrics**: Usage patterns by role
- **Access Logs**: Track role-based feature usage
- **Security Alerts**: Monitor for unusual access patterns

### üîê Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users receive minimum necessary permissions
2. **Role Separation**: Financial and administrative functions are separated
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodic review of role assignments
4. **Secure Role Changes**: All role modifications require proper authorization
5. **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of role changes and access patterns
