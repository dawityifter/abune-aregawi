## ⏭️ Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend (If Not Auto-Deployed)

If your backend doesn't auto-deploy from git:

```bash
# On your production server or Railway/Heroku
git pull origin main
npm install
pm2 restart backend
# or
npm start
```

**Or if using Railway:**
- Push to GitHub will trigger auto-deploy
- Railway will detect new dependencies and restart

### 2. Test Backend API

```bash
# Test income categories endpoint
curl https://your-backend-url.com/api/income-categories

# Expected: JSON with 9 income categories
```

### 3. Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

### 4. Verify Frontend

1. Open: https://abune-aregawi-church-app.web.app
2. Login as Treasurer/Admin
3. Go to Treasurer Dashboard
4. Click "Add Payment"
5. Verify:
   - Income Category field appears (read-only)
   - Auto-assigns based on payment type
6. Create test transaction
7. Verify GL Code column appears in transaction list

## 🔍 What Was Skipped

**Ledger Entries (3 migrations skipped):**
- ❌ addNewPaymentTypesToLedgerEnum.js
- ❌ updateLedgerEntryTransactionId.js
- ❌ updateLedgerEntryTypeEnum.js

**Why Skipped:**
- Production doesn't have `ledger_entries` table
- Not needed for Income GL Codes feature
- Can be added later if needed

**Impact:**
- ✅ Income GL Codes work perfectly without ledger entries
- ✅ Expense tracking works
- ✅ All core features operational

---
