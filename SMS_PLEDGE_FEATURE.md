# SMS Broadcast for Pledge Groups - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Feature Added

Added ability to send SMS reminders to members based on their pledge status:
- **Pending Pledges** - Send reminders to members with unfulfilled pledges
- **Fulfilled Pledges** - Send thank you messages to members who completed pledges

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### **1. Backend - SMS Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/smsController.js`)

#### **Added Two New Functions:**

**A. `sendPendingPledges`**
- Queries all pledges with `status = 'pending'`
- Gets unique members (deduplicated by member_id)
- Sends SMS to all active members with pending pledges
- Logs to `sms_logs` table with `recipient_type = 'pending_pledges'`

**B. `sendFulfilledPledges`**
- Queries all pledges with `status = 'fulfilled'`
- Gets unique members (deduplicated by member_id)
- Sends SMS to all active members with fulfilled pledges
- Logs to `sms_logs` table with `recipient_type = 'fulfilled_pledges'`

#### **Key Features:**
- ✅ Deduplication: Members with multiple pledges only receive one SMS
- ✅ Only sends to active members (`is_active = true`)
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Returns success count and total sent

---

### **2. Backend - Routes** (`backend/src/routes/smsRoutes.js`)

**Added Routes:**
```javascript
POST /api/sms/sendPendingPledges
POST /api/sms/sendFulfilledPledges
```

**Authorization:** Requires `admin`, `church_leadership`, or `secretary` role

---

### **3. Frontend - SMS Broadcast UI** (`frontend/src/components/admin/SmsBroadcast.tsx`)

#### **Updated Recipient Types:**
- Individual
- Department
- **Pending Pledges** ⭐ NEW
- **Fulfilled Pledges** ⭐ NEW
- All Members

#### **UI Changes:**
- Added two new buttons for pledge groups
- Endpoint routing logic updated
- Success messages customized for each pledge type

## 🧪 How to Test

### **1. Test Locally (Currently Running)**

**Frontend:** http://localhost:3000  
**Backend:** http://localhost:5001

#### **Steps:**
1. Go to **Admin Dashboard → SMS Broadcast** (or `/sms`)
2. Select **"Pending Pledges"** recipient type
3. Enter a test message (e.g., "Reminder: Your pledge is pending. Thank you!")
4. Click **Send SMS**
5. Check the success message showing how many sent

Repeat for **"Fulfilled Pledges"** with a thank you message.

---

### **2. Expected Results**

#### **Pending Pledges:**
```
Success message: "Message sent to members with pending pledges. Success: X / Y"
```

#### **Fulfilled Pledges:**
```
Success message: "Message sent to members with fulfilled pledges. Success: X / Y"
```

#### **If No Members Found:**
```
Error: "No members with [pending/fulfilled] pledges found"
```

## 📊 Database Queries

### **Pending Pledges Query:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT m.*
FROM pledges p
INNER JOIN members m ON p.member_id = m.id
WHERE p.status = 'pending' 
  AND m.is_active = true
  AND m.phone_number IS NOT NULL;
```

### **Fulfilled Pledges Query:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT m.*
FROM pledges p
INNER JOIN members m ON p.member_id = m.id
WHERE p.status = 'fulfilled' 
  AND m.is_active = true
  AND m.phone_number IS NOT NULL;
```

## 🔒 Security & Logging

### **Authentication:**
- ✅ Firebase auth required
- ✅ Role-based access (admin, church_leadership, secretary)

### **Logging:**

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Test the Feature:**
1. ✅ Backend running on port 5001
2. ✅ Frontend running on port 3000
3. Test both pledge types
4. Verify SMS delivery (if Twilio configured)
5. Check `sms_logs` table for records

### **After Testing:**
- Commit changes
- Push to GitHub
- Deploy (auto-deploys via GitHub Actions)

## 💡 Usage Examples

### **Pending Pledge Reminder:**
```
"Hi {First Name}, this is a friendly reminder about your pending pledge of ${Amount}. 
We appreciate your commitment to the church. God bless!"
```

### **Fulfilled Pledge Thank You:**
```
"Thank you {First Name} for fulfilling your pledge of ${Amount}! 
Your generous support helps our church community thrive. God bless you!"
```

**Note:** Variable substitution like `{First Name}` would need to be added if desired (future enhancement).
